Write a JS function that takes three string arguments as an input. Calculate the sum of the length of the strings 
and the average length of the strings rounded down to the nearest integer. The input comes as three string 
arguments passed to your function. The output should be printed on the console on two lines.

If the argument type is NOT a number, print the following text on the console: 
'We can not calculate the circle area, because we receive a {type of argument}.'
The input comes as a single argument passed to your function. The output should be printed on the console.

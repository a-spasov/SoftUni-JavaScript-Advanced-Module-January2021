01. List of Items
Write a function that read the text inside an input field and appends the specified text to a list inside an 
HTML page.

02. Add / Delete
Extend the previous problem to display a [Delete] link after each list item. Clicking it, should delete the 
item with no confirmation. You have to add href="#" to the link element.

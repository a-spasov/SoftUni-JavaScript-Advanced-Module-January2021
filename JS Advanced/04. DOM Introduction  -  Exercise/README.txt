01. Subtraction
An HTML page holds two text fields with ids "firstNumber" and "secondNumber". Write a function to subtract the 
values from these text fields and display the result in the div named "result".
Implement the above to provide the following functionality: 
	• Your function should take the values of "firstNumber" and "secondNumber", convert them to numbers, 
	subtract the second number from the first one and then append the result to the <div> with id="result".
	• Your function should be able to work with any 2 numbers in the inputs, not only the ones given in the 
	example.

02. Pascal or Camel Case
An html file is given and your task is to write a function that takes two string parameters as an input and 
transform the first parameter to the type required by the second parameter.
	• The first parameter will be the text that you need to modify depending on the second parameter. The 
	words in it will always be separated by space.
	• The second parameter will be either "Camel Case" or "Pascal Case". In case of a different input, you 
	your output should be "Error!"
When the button is clicked the function should convert the first string to either of the cases. The output 
should consist of only one word - the string you have modified. Once your output is done, you should set it as 
a HTML to the <span> element. 

03. Accordion
An html file is given and your task is to show more/less information by clicking the [More] button , it should 
reveal the content of a hidden div and changes the text of the button to [Less]. When the same link is clicked 
again (now reading Less), hide the div and change the text of the link to More. Link action should be 
toggleable (you should be able to click the button infinite amount of times).

04. Search in List
An HTML page holds a list of towns, a search box and a [Search] button. Implement the search function to bold 
and underline the items from the list which include the text from the search box. Also print the amount of 
items the current search matches in the format "<matches> matches found".

05.Tab le - Search Engine
Write a function that searches in a table by given input.
When the "Search" button is clicked, go through all cells in the table except for the first row (Student name, 
Student email and Student course) and check if the given input has a match (check for both full words and 
single letters).
If any of the rows contain the submitted string, add a select class to that row. Note that more than one row 
may contain the given string. 
Оtherwise, if there is no match, nothing should happen.

01. Subtraction
An HTML page holds two text fields with ids "firstNumber" and "secondNumber". Write a function to subtract the 
values from these text fields and display the result in the div named "result".
Implement the above to provide the following functionality: 
	• Your function should take the values of "firstNumber" and "secondNumber", convert them to numbers, 
	subtract the second number from the first one and then append the result to the <div> with id="result".
	• Your function should be able to work with any 2 numbers in the inputs, not only the ones given in the 
	example.

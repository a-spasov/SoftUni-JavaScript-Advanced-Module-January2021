01. Sections
You will receive an array of strings. For each string, create a div with a paragraph with the string in it. 
Each paragraph is initially hidden (display:none). Add a click event listener to each div that displays the 
hidden paragraph. Finally, you should append all divs to the element with an id "content".

02. Time Converter
Create a program that converts different time units. Your task is to add a click event listener to all 
[CONVERT] buttons. When a button is clicked, read the corresponding input field, convert the value to the three
other time units and display it in the input fields.

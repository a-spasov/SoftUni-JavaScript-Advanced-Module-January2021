01. Sections
You will receive an array of strings. For each string, create a div with a paragraph with the string in it. 
Each paragraph is initially hidden (display:none). Add a click event listener to each div that displays the 
hidden paragraph. Finally, you should append all divs to the element with an id "content".

02. Time Converter
Create a program that converts different time units. Your task is to add a click event listener to all 
[CONVERT] buttons. When a button is clicked, read the corresponding input field, convert the value to the three
other time units and display it in the input fields.

03. Locked Profile
In this problem, you should create a JS functonality which shows and hides the additional information about 
users. When one of the [Show more] buttons is clicked, the hiden information inside the div should be shown, 
only if the profile is not locked! If the current profile is locked, nothing should happen. If the hidden 
information is displayed and we lock the profile again, the [Hide it] button should not be working! Otherwise, 
when the profile is unlocked and we click on the [Hide it] button, the new fields must hide again.

01. Even Position Element
Write a function that finds the elements at even positions in an array. The input comes as array of string 
elements. The output is printed on the console. Collect all elements in a string, separated by space.

02. Last K Numbers Sequence
You are given two integers n and k. Write a JS function that generates and return the following sequence:
	• The first element is 1;
	• Every following element equals the sum of the previous k elements;
	• The length of the sequence is n elements;
The input comes as two number arguments. The first element represents the number n, and the second – the number k.
The output is the return value of your function and should be an array of numbers.

03. Sum First Last
Write a function that calculates and return the sum of the first and the last elements in an array.
The input comes as array of string elements holding numbers.
The output is the return value of your function and should be a number.

04. Negative / Positive Numbers
Write a JS function that processes the elements in an array one by one and produces a new array. Prepend each 
negative element at the front of the result and append each positive (or 0) element at the end of the result.
The input comes as array of number elements. The output is printed on the console, each element on a new line.

05. Smallest Two Numbers
Write a function that prints the two smallest elements from an array of numbers.
The input comes as array of number elements.
The output is printed on the console on a single line, separated by space.

06. Bigger Half
You are given an array of numbers. Write a JS function that sorts the array in ascending order and returns a new 
array, containing only the second half of the input. If there are an odd number of elements in the input, always 
take the bigger half. For example, if the input array contains 4 elements, the output should be 2, and if the 
input is 5 – the output is 3.
The input comes as array of number elements.
The output is the return value of the function and should be an array of numbers.

7. Piece of Pie
Write a function that receives three parameters – an array of pie flavors as strings two target flavors as strings.
The result of the function should be a new array, containing a section of the original array, starting at the first
flavor parameter, and ending at (and including) the second flavor parameter.
The input comes as three arguments:
	• An array of strings, representing pie flavors
	• Two more strings, representing the start and end of the section, respectively
The output is the return value of the function and should be an array of strings.
